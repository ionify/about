## team

[**team ionify**](https://github.com/orgs/ionify/people)

& reliable
[experiences](http://ionified.net) for all.

We've developed and distributed [**ion**](#ion) & the [**ionify api**](#api) since their initial
[discovery, definition & development](story.md)
by [Michael Lee](https://github.com/iskitz) in 2007 and continue to build on and advance that work today.

implicit object notations implemented for you**, is a flexible, unobtrusive & novel
[api](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)
that simplifies object interaction, observation & notification via
**ion: implicit object notation**.


### ion

**[ion](ions/ion.md): implicit object notation**, is a software
[design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)

[data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing))
and
[code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code)
as independently observable & notifiable objects.
