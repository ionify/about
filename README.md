  that enables object notification by observing the object's conversion to a
  [foundational data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_data_type).


+ **ionify: [implicit object notation invented for you](https://github.com/ionify/ionify)**,
  is a set of [**ions**](ion.md) that enable + simplify object interaction,
  observation + notification by implementing [**eon**](eon.md).

  is a japanese language-skills game created with [**ions**](ion.md) to
  exercise + guide [**ionify's**](https://github.com/ionify/ionify) api.


+ **jeni: [jeni enables natural interaction](https://rawgit.com/ionified/jeni-ions.iskitz.net/public/)**,
  is [a set](https://github.com/ionified/jeni-ions.iskitz.net)
  of [**ions**](ion.md) that
