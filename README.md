**ionify** is a [team](#team) and an [api](#api).

## team

[**team ionify**](https://github.com/orgs/ionify/people)
invents optimized natural interfaces for you, and aspires to create accessible,
[simple](https://cdn.rawgit.com/ionified/anemojii-ions.iskitz.net/public/),
performant,
[intuitive](https://github.com/ionified/jeni-ions.iskitz.net/blob/public/jeni.play.js)
& reliable
[experiences](http://ionified.net) for all.

We've developed and published [**ion**](#ion), [**itc**](#itc) & [**ionify**](#api) since their initial
[discovery, definition, and development](story.md)
by [Michael Lee](https://github.com/iskitz)
in 2007.


## ion

**[ion](ions/ion.md): invoked object notation**, is a language-independent
[syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages))
that enables writing
[data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing))
and
[code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code)
as independently observable & notifiable objects.


## itc

[**interactive type conversion**](ions/ion.md#interactive-type-conversion) is a
[programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)
capability and
[software design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)
that enables interacting with objects during their type conversion flow. **ion**
is enabled by and activates **itc**.


## api

**[ionify](https://github.com/ionify/ionify):
ions interpreted for you**, is a flexible, unobtrusive, natural-language
[api](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)
for expressing ideas via **invoked object notations**.
