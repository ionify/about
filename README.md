**ionify** is a [team](#team) and an [api](#api).

## [team](https://github.com/orgs/ionify/people)

**team ionify** invents optimized natural interfaces for you, and aspires to
create accessible,
[simple](https://cdn.rawgit.com/ionified/anemojii-ions.iskitz.net/public/),
performant,
[intuitive](https://github.com/ionified/jeni-ions.iskitz.net/blob/public/jeni.play.js)
& reliable
[experiences](http://ionified.net) for all.

We've developed and published [**ion**](#ion), [**itc**](#itc) & [**ionify**](#api) since their initial
[discovery, definition, and development](story.md)
by [Michael Lee](https://github.com/iskitz)
in 2007.


## [ion](ions/ion.md)

**invoked object notation**, is a language-independent
[syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages))
that enables writing
[data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing))
and
[code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code)
as independently observable & notifiable objects.


## [itc](ions/ion.md#interactive-type-computation)

**interactive type computation** is a
[software design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)
that applies various
[programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)
capabilities to enable interacting with objects during their type's
[conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_conversion)
and
[operator overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overloading)
computations. **ion** is enabled by and activates **itc**.


## [api](https://github.com/ionify/ionify)

**ionify: ions interpreted for you**, is a flexible, unobtrusive,
natural-language
[api](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)
for expressing ideas via **ions: invoked object notations**.

  that
  [explores](https://cdn.rawgit.com/ionified/jeni-ions.iskitz.net/public/)
  [natural language programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_programming)
