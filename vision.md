Seamlessly share ideas

+ **visually**: via colors, drawings & pictures

+ **audibly**: via verbally spoken languages, verbal & non-verbal sounds

+ **tactilely**: via touch-sensed textures & patterns

+ **textually**: via written words


## how

Via automated & accessible software creation & interaction:

```
            seamless idea sharing
                     ^
     cdns: jsdelivr, cdnjs, etc. :cdns
                     ^
          visual, audible, tactile
                     ^
                  textual
                     ^
                 :ionified: 
              ions indexed for
         internet-enabled discovery
                 :ionified:
                     ^
   ionify: ion implemented for you :ionify
                     ^
 dions: domain-specific language ions :dions
                     ^
      ion: invoked object notation :ion
                     ^
         javascript, python & java
                     ^
                  :pools:
                procedural
           operator-overloading
                 languages
                  :pools:
```

### automation

Software can self-assemble & self-improve if its data & behavior can be programmatically
discovered, inspected & tested for compatibility & quality.

[**ion**](ions/ion.md#ion) & [**ionify**](http://api.ionify.net/)
enable defining that kind of data &
behavior:


```javascript
~
{ re:
    { id: 'thing@some.doma.in'
    , as: 'a.schema.defined.thing'
    , by: 'mike.lee@ionify.net'
    , on: -4.200709
    , to: -7.20200413
    , at: +2.5
    , it: "defines an internet-discoverable, versioned, "
        + "schema-defined & inspectable thing."
    }
}
```


#### ionify

Exists to make automatic & accessible
software creation real. It enables mapping a word, symbol, or group of words and-or symbols to
specific & discoverable behavior. This mapping enables observing & reacting to objects containing those words
and-or symbols.

**ionify** enables

+ locating & fetching **ions** via the internet

+ schema definition & application for ion inspection & validation

+ implementing & sharing the ions, words & symbols needed to define discoverable data & behavior.

## accessibility

Software can be created without learning 20th-century programming language vocabulary & constructs. If
data & behavior can be expressed via code-as-prose, that should enable software
interpretation of its meaning.

**ion** enables expressing code as prose via words joined or separated by mathematical
operators:

```javascript
each - of - these - words - means & does - something;
```

as regular-expression literals:

```javascript
~/ each of these words means & does something /
```

and as one or more strings within an array

```javascript
~[" each of these words means & does something "]
```
