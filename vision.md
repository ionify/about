# vision

Software creation can be automatic & accessible.
[**ion**: invoked object notation](ions/ion.md#ion) makes that possible.

## automatic

Software can self-assemble & self-improve if its data & behavior can be programmatically
discovered, inspected & tested for compatibility & quality. **ion** enables defining data &
behavior this way.

```javascript
~
{ re:
    { id: 'thing@some.doma.in'
    , as: 'a.schema.defined.thing'
    , by: 'mike.lee@ionify.net'
    , on: -4.200709
    , to: -8.20200117
    , is: +2.4
    , it: "defines an internet-discoverable, versioned, "
        + "schema-defined & inspectable thing."
    }
}
```

## accessible

Software can be created without learning programming language vocabulary & constructs. If
data & behavior can be expressed in code as prose, that should be sufficient for software to
interpret its meaning.

**ion** enables expressing code as prose via words joined or separated by mathematical
operators,

```javascript
each - of - these - words - means & does - something;
```

as regular expression literals,

```javascript
~/ each of these words means & does something /
```

and as one or more strings within an array

```javascript
~[" each of these words means & does something "]
```

## how

[**ionify**: ion implemented for you](http://api.ionify.net/) exists to make this vision of automatic & accessible
software creation real. It enables mapping a word, symbol, or group of words and-or symbols to
specific & discoverable behavior. This mapping enables observing & reacting to objects containing those words
and-or symbols.

**ionify** will realize this vision by

+ locating & fetching **ions** via the internet

+ enabling schema definition & application for ion inspection & validation

+ implementing & sharing the ions, words & symbols needed to define discoverable data & behavior.
