# vision

Seamlessly share ideas

+ **visually**: via colors, drawings & pictures

+ **audibly**: via verbally spoken languages, verbal & non-verbal sounds

+ **tactilely**: via touch-sensed textures & patterns

+ **textually**: via written words


## how

Via well-defined, discoverable, accessible & observable software entities:

```
            seamless idea sharing
                      ^
cdns: github, npm, ..., jsdelivr, cdnjs, :cdns
                      ^
           visual, audible, tactile
                      ^
                   textual
                      ^
                  :ionified:
               ions indexed for
               internet-enabled
                  discovery
                  :ionified:
                      ^
 opus: orion prose understands sentences :opus
                      ^

                      ^
  dions: domain-specific language ions :dions
                      ^
      ion: invoked object notation :ion
                      ^
          javascript, python & java
                      ^
                   :pools:
                 procedural
            operator-overloading
                  languages
                   :pools:
```

### entities

[**ion**](ions/ion.md#ion) & [**ionify**](https://api.ionify.net/)
enable defining discoverable, accessible & observable data & behavior:


```javascript
~
{ re:
    { id: 'thing@ionified.net'
    , as: 'a.schema.defined.thing'
    , by: 'mike.lee'
    , on: -4.200709
    , to: -7.20200428
    , at: +3.1
    , it: "defines an internet-discoverable, versioned, "
        + "schema-defined & observable thing."
    }
}
```


#### ionify

Enables mapping words and-or symbols to specific & discoverable data & behavior.
This mapping enables observing & reacting to objects containing those words
and-or symbols.

**ionify** enables

+ locating & fetching **ions** via the internet

+ schema definition & application for ion observation & validation

+ implementing & sharing the ions, words & symbols needed to define
discoverable data & behavior.

## accessibility

Software can be created without learning 20th-century programming language
vocabulary or constructs. If data & behavior can be expressed as prose,
software should be able to interpret its meaning.

**ion** enables expressing code as prose via words joined or separated by
mathematical operators:

```javascript
each - of - these - words - means & does - something;
```

as invoked regular-expression literals:

```javascript
~/ each of these words means & does something /
```

and as one or more strings within an array

```javascript
~[" each of these words means & does something "]
```
