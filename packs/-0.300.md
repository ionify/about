introduces & defines the [**`ionosphere`**](#ionosphere) & other
[`relation@s`](#relations), and stabilizes & elaborates
[`connection@s`](#connections), [`sensation@s`](#sensations) &
[`action@s`](#actions)

## implementation

+ **at** <https://github.com/ionify/ionify/compare/-0.200...-0.300>
+ **by** [**🙇🏾‍♂️ יהוה 🤲🏾**](https://deal.ionify.net/),
  [**mike🇬🇾👨🏾‍💻🇺🇸lee**](https://github.com/iskitz)
  & [**team✨ionify**](https://team.ionify.net/)

## `ionosphere`

+ the **invoked object notation observation sphere**
+ defined as a [`relation@`](#relations) via [ionify's](https://meet.ionify.net/)
  [`configuration@`](#sions-structured-invoked-object-notations)
+ the collection of ids & names of all **ions** & their supporting functions &
  operations implementing **ionify's** `connection@s`, `relation@s`,
  [`sensation@s`](#sensations) & [`action@s`](#actions)

## `connection@s`

### `with`

+ `its`
  + consistently references an **ion**'s `initiation@` or itself if it's
    self-initiated
  + `initiation@s` are initial definitions of, or references to, actions
    and-or information
+ `in.*`
  + references an **ion**'s `association@s`
  + `association@s` are an **ion**'s `re.of` named [ionosphere](#ionosphere)
    collections

+ `in.domain` & `our`
  + references an **ion**'s `organization@`
  + references `with.all` if an **ion** has no `organization@`
  + references the `with.the ["ion's full-domain-named"]` `association@`
  + `organization@s` are domain-named [ionosphere](#ionosphere) collections of
    actions and-or information

## `relation@s`

+ are named-[ionosphere](#ionosphere) collections that define the relationships
  between **ions** and their required and-or desired actions & information

### `re`

+ `as` `~get.s` an **ion**'s `specification@s`
+ `do` `~get.s` an **ion**'s action and-or information `adoption@s`

## `sensation@s`

+ now invoke multiple `reaction@s` when present
+ don't unintentionally self-react, even when duplicated

### `do` some reaction@

+ `on` sensing one or more terms within an **ion**
+ `if` conditions affirm
  + `all` of the terms have been sensed
  + `any` of the terms have been sensed
  + a `#` of the terms have been sensed

## `action@s`

### `do` some action@

+ `for` a specific object

## progression

### sions: structured invoked object notations

+ `re.as.configuration` for application & other settings
+ `re.at` for an action and-or information's `version@`
+ `re.on` & `re.to`
  + `instantiation@s` for initial & present **ion** instants
  + `instantiation@s` add **dow**: day-of-week as a single digit
  + [`instantiation@s`](https://baramita.github.io/specs/)
    + **elaborated**

## evolution

+ [`with`](#with)
  + `its` inconsistently referenced an ion's `initiation@` or itself
  + `its.domain` referenced an ion's [`organization@`](#with)

+ `re.on` & `re.to` were sometimes [`instantiation@s`](#sions-structured-invoked-object-notations)
  with
  + signed & prefixed single-digit timezone hour offsets
  + signed & prefixed double-digit timezone hour offsets & calendar ids
  + **dow**: day-of-week information omitted
  + **oli**: object-literal, with aforementioned as names & values
