🌱 progression

+ our God 🙇🏾‍♂️🎉 יהוה 🎊🤲🏾 created us & everything that enables our productions
  so we acclaim Him in all we produce.

+ the ~on.has.is.id.do.no api [5] explores

  + sensing ions [6] by their composition, specification@ & identification@,
    then reacting to & forgetting those sensation@s, and

  + sim: semantic ion members that encapsulate & encode ion members' information
    as sions: semantic invoked object notations.
