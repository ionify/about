+ `as` `specification@s`
+ `by` producers
+ `on` initial `instantiation@`
+ `to` present `instantiation@`
+ `at` `version@`
+ `in` producers' locations
+ `it` summative informational terms

   vs afterwards as `~get.then` does

## evolution

+ `re.at` was an `instantiation@` or location
+ `re.as` was informational terms
+ `re.is` was a `version@` or `specification@`
+ `re.it` was one or more `description@s`
+ `re.to` was a `connection@` for sharing
+ `with.*` was a `connection@` to the ion
