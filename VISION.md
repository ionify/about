### [ion](ions/ion.md#ion)

**invoked object notation** enables defining discoverable, accessible &
observable actions & information with detailed attribute descriptions:

```javascript
~
{ re:
    { id:  'thing@ionified.net'
    , of: ['ionify','education']
    , as:  'a.specified.thing'
    , by:  'mike.🇬🇾👨🏾‍💻🇺🇸.lee'
    , on:  -4.200709
    , to:  -8.20221213
    , at:  +5.01
    , is:
        [ "the ion: invoked object notation "
        , "definition of an internet-discoverable "
        , "specified, observable & versioned thing"
        ],
      it:
        [ "lists", "these", "tags", "to", "aid"
        , "its", "discovery", "via", "internet"
        , "and", "local", "queries"
        ]
    },

  with:
    { all:
        { these:
            [ "detailed"
            , "attribute"
            , "descriptions"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### [ionify](https://about.ionify.net/)

**ion implemented for you**, enables defining, acquiring, sensing & interacting with
[**ions**](#ion):

```javascript
~
{ on:'my'
, my( ion )
    {
    + {log: ion.my}
    }
}

~
{ get:'my.ion@ionified.net' }

^
{ re: {id:'my.ion@ionified.net'}
, my: "ion definition @ domain!"
}
```

### code as prose

  code expressed as natural-language prose:

+ [**captions**: code-as-prose terminology ions](https://github.com/ionify/ionify/blob/public/README.md#code-as-prose),
  express code as words, via
  [object-reference](LINGO.md#orion) [ions](#ion),
  punctated by mathematical and-or comparison operators:

  ```javascript
  each - word - means & does - something
  ```

+ [**stories**: stated text of recognition expressions](ions/stories.md#stories),
  express code as words within
  [**recognitions**: recognizing ions](ions/stories.md#stories) --
  invoked regular-expressions:

  ```javascript
  ~/ each word means & does something /
  ```

+ [**aesops**: array-expressed stories or phrases](ions/aesop.md#aesop),
  express code as one or more [**stories**](ions/stories.md#stories),
  or phrases, within invoked arrays:

  ```javascript
  ~[/ each word means & does something /]
  +[" each word means & does something "]
  ```

### [ionified](https://ionified.net/)

**ions indexed for internet-enabled discovery**, is a directory of
internet-discoverable **ions** that [**ionify**](#ionify) queries to discover & verify
[**ions**](#ion).
