### [ions](ions/ion.md#ion)

invoked object notations enable defining discoverable, accessible & observable
things with detailed attribute descriptions:

```javascript
~
{ re:
    { id: 'thing@ionified.net'
    , as: 'a.schema.defined.thing'
    , by: 'mike.lee'
    , on: -4.200709
    , to: -7.20200501
    , at: +4.0
    , is: "the ion: invoked object notation"
        + " definition of an internet-discoverable,"
        + " schema-defined, observable & versioned"
        + " thing."
    },

  with:
    { some: 1
    ,   or: ["more", "attributes"]
    }
}
```

### [ionify](https://api.ionify.net/)

ion implemented for you, enables defining, fetching, sensing & interacting with
accessible [ions](#ions):

```javascript
~ { on:'my' ,
    my( ion )
      { /sense my ion,    :2//
        /log  its data    :3//
        {log: ion.my}
      }
  }

~ {get:'my.ion@ionified.net'}
~ {my :"data"} <= /got my :1/
```

### code as prose

  code expressed as natural language prose via [object reference](LINGO.md#orion) [ions](#ions):

+ [**opus**: orion prose understands sentences](https://github.com/ionify/ionify/blob/public/README.md#code-prose),
  enables code as words joined and-or separated by mathematical operators:

  ```javascript
  each - word - means & does - something;
  ```

+ [**stories**: sentence text or recognition expressions](LINGO.md#storie),
  enable code as words within invoked regular-expression literals:

  ```javascript
  ~/ each word means & does something /
  ```

+ [**aesop**: array-expressed sentence or phrase](LINGO.md#aesop),
  enables code as one or more strings of words within arrays

  ```javascript
  ~[" each word means & does something "]
  ```

### [ionified](https://ionified.net/)

[ions](#ions) indexed for internet-enabled discovery, is a repository of
internet-discoverable ions that [ionify](#ionify) queries, along with
others, to authenticate ions.
