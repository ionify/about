seamlessly share ideas & information

+ **visually**: via colors, drawings, pictures & video

+ **audibly**: via spoken languages, verbal & non-verbal sounds

+ **tactilely**: via touch-sensed textures & patterns

+ **textually**: via written words, phrases & prose


## how

via well-defined, discoverable, accessible & observable

### [ions](ions/ion.md#ion)

enable defining discoverable, accessible & observable data & behavior via
granular attribute description:

```javascript
~
{ re:
    { id: 'thing@ionified.net'
    , as: 'a.schema.defined.thing'
    , by: 'mike.lee'
    , on: -4.200709
    , to: -7.20200501
    , at: +4.0
    , is: "the ion: invoked object notation"
        + " definition of an internet-discoverable,"
        + " schema-defined, observable & versioned"
        + " thing."
    },

  with:
    { some: 1
    ,   or: ["more", "attributes"]
    }
}
```

### [ionify](https://api.ionify.net/)

enables defining, fetching, observing & interacting with discoverable ions
that describe one or more thing's attributes:

```javascript
~
{ on:'my',
  my(ion)
    { /observe my ion  :3//
      /log its "data!" :4//
      {log: ion.my}
    }
}

~ {get:'my.data@ionified.net'}
| /get  this 'my' data ion :1/
~ {my :"data!"}   <=  /got :2/
```

## [opus](https://github.com/ionify/ionify/blob/public/README.md#code-prose)

**ions** can be used without learning 20th-century programming language
vocabulary by expressing them as words joined or separated by mathematical operators:

```javascript
each - of - these - words - means & does - something;
```

as invoked regular-expression literals:

```javascript
~/ each of these words means & does something /
```

and as one or more strings of words in an array

```javascript
~[" each of these words means & does something "]
```
