# ion: a hidden universe

## abstract



## intro: 20s = 4 slides

What if I told you there's a world, a universe, hidden right before our eyes, in the code we read & write every day? What if I told you it's always been there?

Would you believe me? 🧐
Would you follow me there? 🤔


## invitation: 60s - 6 slides

```javascript
how == json --> browser - (xhr & eval | fetch)

; <script/>   ?  'invalid | inaccessible data'
:  jsonp ()  ?  '  valid &   accessible code'
:   what    ==  '  valid &   accessible data'
;
```

### meditation: 

What is json?

```javascript
{ "json" :   "data"  }  // is an
{ object : 'literal' }  /* is an */   Object
```

####.

also...

```javascript
[        "json"     ]   // is an
[  'array literal'  ]   /* is an */   Array
```

####.

Are `Object & Array` alike?

Yes.

How?

Both have `constructor & prototype` properties & methods.

Do any of those make Object & Array-based json accessible?

####.

Constructors create but don't help us interface with json's construction flow.

json can't access its properties & can't set its prototype's. 

What about its prototype's methods?

####.

```javascript
prototype [unity & sharing] --> access
```

We can get or set its properties, but json 

& methods 


```javascript
`toString () --> 'hello' + {json:'data'}`
 `valueOf () -->         + {json:'data'}`
```
