            domain spaces

            Enable ions to set a share property that contains things to share
            within its domain. ionify will combine those things with all others
            already being shared within the ion's domain.

            ion Type sensor delegator:

            It may be more sensible to create an ion Type sensor delegator that
            ensures all ions have an id & that they & their ionified content have
            a reference to their host ion.

            It may then also make sense to have an ion Type cleanup that removes
            those ion references for memory performance. May be good enough to
            only note this for now & revisit if performance needs to be improved.

            The delegator would do common actions for all ion types then delegate
            to the relevant ion's Type sensor.

            onSensor > normalize [id & link] > onType:

            When a sensor's defined, set its handler as a generated method that
            ensures each of the sensor's ions have an id, have their methods &
            array members linked to that ion, and then call the sensor's defined
            handler.

            Achieved via ~share.as.to.
            Was trying to figure what to do next. I want to continue modularizing
            ionify so that it's easier to create new parts. Currently it's still
            more complicated than I'd like to share functionality between sensors
            like on.ion, on.aeon, and on.aesop. Maybe by figuring out how to
            make each it's own module I'll solve this sharing problem. My current
            focus is solving the ionify.sense & ionified dependency shared by
            on.ion, on.sensor, on.aeon & on.aesop.

            Maybe my past idea of creating a shared namespace for ions with the
            same @domain is what I need here but I want to protect against ions
            that falsely claim @domain membership. I don't want to focus too much
            on that but also don't want to create a solution that can't be easily
            extended with that protection.
